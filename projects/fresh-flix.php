        <p class="project-summary"> Fresh Flix is a dynamic movie database I made with a group of two others. Using <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/"> The Movie DB's </a> API connection, this React Application dynamically updates to show the most up to date data dependant on the user's filtering options. A user can filter movies by 'popular', 'top rated', 'upcoming', or movies 'now playing'. A user can also favourite movies that interest them, those movies are stored on their local storage and displayed to them on the 'favourites' page.  </p>

        <h3> My Design Process </h3>

            <p>This project began with a simple wireframe which I then made into a high-fidelity mock-up using photoshop. Using Invision, I then turned my mockup into a prototype. Below are links to my prototypes, feel free to have a click around:</p>
            <div class="prototype-links">
                <a href="https://invis.io/BP10NK5XZ9WQ" class="desktop-proto-link" target="_blank">Desktop Prototype</a>
                <a href="https://invis.io/8X10NKE74Y6S" class="mobile-proto-link" target="_blank">Mobile Prototype</a>

<h3>Development </h3>

    <p>
        This project was done in a group with two other students. Although they had also made mockup designs and prototypes for a Movie Database, we all agreed to use mine. This project challenged our understanding of both React and Github as we were all new to both tools. I helped the group make a development plan, organizing the project into smaller, easier to manage tasks; this allowed us to properly prioritize tasks that either seemed large or more complicated than others.

    <p> Below you can see some code I used to create the favouriting functionality:</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, our new Github skills were put to the test in this project. We began overly cautious, making a local copy of our work every time we went to merge for fear of losing anything. However, as time went on and we figured out our rythm as a team with Github, it became easier and easier to deal with the occasional merge conflict or accidental merge to the master.</p>
    <p>This was the first major project that I worked with a team on, and although there was some added complication with sharing our work via Github, once we figured that out, the ability to collaborate, share ideas, and see my design grow with their input was very rewarding in the end. I'm very proud of this site. Please enjoy!</p>
