        <p> This Portfolio is to showcase my projects and skills in Web Development. In this project I used a base of PHP, SCSS, Javascript, and HTML. My portfolio has had many faces since I began learning these new skills, and it will likely have many more in the course of my career. Read more to see some of the other faces: </p>

        <h3> My Design Process </h3>

            <p>I began designing my portfolio with a very different idea in mind. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/a1c0beff-2e3f-43fc-b9ee-0f3e1426c82a-f493/">HERE</a> to see my initial design.</p>
            <p>Before building this site, I redid my wireframes, below you can see the wireframes behind this version of my portfolio:</p>

<h3>Development </h3>

    <p>
        I began this project as a React App but ended up changing my mind to hard coding in order to get more practice with HTML5, SASS, PHP, and JavaScript. I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to try but had three key functionalities that were non-negotiable: 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A slider for my projects</li>
            <li>A thumb driven navigation</li>
            <li>The ability for the user to have styling options</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        As I began working on the project, I had the idea of a colour changing background and spend a good deal of time building that and debugging. <b>If you haven't already, please click one of the buttons on the top right of the page and check out my other page styles!</b>
    </p>
    <p> Below you can see some of the code I used in my portfolio:</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p> I found this project to be quite difficult, not due to the coding, but in trying to portray my personality and style. However, it was also fun to have the freedom to try new things and really test my skills. I ended up surprising myself with some of the functionality I created and I look forward to see how it progresses as time goes on. </p>
